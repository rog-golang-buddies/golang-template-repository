### Steps

üéõÔ∏è  &nbsp; Configure gh-pages as per instructions [here](https://rog-golang-buddies.github.io/golang-template-repository/continuous-integration/mkdocs-material/#ci-setup).

üåê &nbsp; Goto your site at `<org>.github.io/<repository>` (the link is also made available via **Environments** section in your Github repo).

‚úã &nbsp; Take a moment to review the [Quickstart guide](docs/quickstart.md) guide before you get started. It has critical prerequisites.

# [Repo name]

## Description

_Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors._


## Installation

_Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection._

## Usage

_Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README._

## Support

_Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc._

## Roadmap

_If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README._

## Contributing

_State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them._

_For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self._

_You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser._

## Authors and acknowledgment

_Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project._
