 ```

### Setup base release for [semantic-release](continuous-integration/semantic-release.md)

‚ö†Ô∏è This is a one time activity. If a tag already exists in the repository this step is not required. If no tags exist proceed to read the next section.

‚ö†Ô∏è  Why is this required?

   Please see [Base release version](continuous-integration/semantic-release.md#base-release-version) documentation for rationale.


   ```bash
   # Within the `main` branch in your git repo
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Pre-release"
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

### Documentation generation via [mkdocs-material](continuous-integration/mkdocs-material.md)


1. Enable `gh-pages` as per the [CI setup](continuous-integration/mkdocs-material.md#ci-setup) instructions.

2. Update `site_name` field in `./mkdocs.yml` file.

### Setup project key for [SonarCloud](continuous-integration/sonarcloud.md)

Add `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY` as a Github secret. This is the value you you typically set for `sonar.projectKey` property in the `sonar-project.properties` file.

### Get template repository updates (optional)

Setup an additional remote to periodically get latest template repository updates.

```bash
git remote add template https://github.com/rog-golang-buddies/golang-template-repository.git
# Update
git fetch template
git merge template/[branch to merge]
```
